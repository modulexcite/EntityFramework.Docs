.. danger::
    **At this stage there are no publicly available builds of EF7 that can be used with a UWP application.**

    The current beta release (Beta 4) does not support UWP. Nightly builds contain work to enable UWP but require updated UWP tooling that is not yet publically available. **We are aiming to enable UWP scenarios with Beta 6 of EF7.**
