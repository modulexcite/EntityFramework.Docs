Configuring Your Model
======================

Entity Framework uses a set of :doc:`default-conventions` to build a model based on the shape of your entity classes. You can specify additional configuration to supplement and/or override what was discovered by convention.
 
.. note::
    This article covers configuration that can be applied to a model targetting any data store and that which can be applied when targetting any relational database. 
    Providers may also enable configuration that is specific to a particular data store. For documentation on provider specific configuration see the the :doc:`/providers/index` section.

Methods of configuration
------------------------

Fluent API
^^^^^^^^^^

You can override the ``OnModelCreating`` method in your derived context and use the ``ModelBuilder`` API to configure your model. This is the most powerful method of configuration and allows configuration to be specified without modifying your entity classes.

Data Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. caution::
    Data Annotations are not yet implemented in Entity Framework 7. You can still add annotations to your entity classes so that they are used by other frameworks (such as ASP.NET MVC), but Entity Framework will not process these annotations. You can track `support for Data Annotations on GitHub <https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/107>`_.

Keys
----

A key serves as the primary unique identifier for each entity instance. When using a relational database this maps to the concept of a *primary key*.

The following fragment shows how to configure a single property to be the key of an entity. In this case ``LicensePlate`` is the primary key of ``Car`` but will not have been detected by the default conventions.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/KeySingle.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-22
        :emphasize-lines: 7-8
        :linenos:

Building on the previous example, let's say that the primary key of ``Car`` is made up of two properties (``State`` and ``LicensePlate``).

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/KeyComposite.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-23
        :emphasize-lines: 7-8
        :linenos:

Indexes
-------

Indexes are a common concept across many data stores. While their implementation in the data store may vary, they are used to make lookups based on a column (or set of columns) more efficient.

The following code shows how to specify an index on a single property. By default, indexes are non-unique.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Index.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-20
        :emphasize-lines: 7-8
        :linenos:

You can also specify that an idex should be unique, meaning that no two entities can have the same value(s) for the given property(s).

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/IndexUnique.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 11-13
        :emphasize-lines: 3
        :linenos:

You can also specify an index over more than one column.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/IndexComposite.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-21
        :emphasize-lines: 7-8
        :linenos:

Required
--------

By default, a property whose type can contain null will be configured as optional (i.e. CLR *reference types* such as ``string``, ``int?``, ``byte[]``, etc.). However, these properties can be configured to be required.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Required.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-21
        :emphasize-lines: 7-9
        :linenos:

.. note::
    A property whose type can not contain null can not be configured as optional (i.e. CLR *value types* such as ``int``, ``bool``, ``decimal``, etc.).

Generated Properties (Identity, Computed, Store Defaults, etc.)
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. caution::
    In Beta 4 there is no general purpose API for configuring how the database generates values for a column. For configuring generated values for a realtional database see `Relational generated properties`_.

.. danger::
    Do not use the `GenerateValueOnAdd` or `StoreComputed` APIs. These affect some lower level building blocks that may cause EF to stop functioning. In future pre-releases these will be removed from the model builder API.

Maximum Length
--------------

Configuring a maximum length provides a hint to the data store about the appropriate data type to use for a given property.

The following code allows the store to choose an appropraite data type for ``Blog.Url`` based on the fact it should only every contain 500 characters. When tagetting SQL Server this would result in the ``nvarchar(500)`` data type being used.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/MaxLength.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-21
        :emphasize-lines: 7-9
        :linenos:

.. note::
    Entity Framework does not do any validation of maximum length before passing data to the provider. It is up to the provider or data store to validate if appropriate.

    For example, when targetting SQL Server, exceding the maximum length will result in an exception as the data type of the underlying column will not allow excess data to be stored.

Concurrency Tokens
------------------

If a property is configured as a concurrency token then EF will check that no other user has modified that value in the database when saving changes to that record. EF uses an optomistic concurrency pattern, meaning it will assume the value has not changed and try to save the data, but throw if it finds the value has been changed.

For example we may want to configure ``SocialSecurityNumber`` on ``Person`` to be a concurrency token. This means that if one user tries to save some changes to a Person, but another user has changed the ``SocialSecurityNumber`` then an exception will be thrown. This may be desirable so that our application can prompt the user to ensure this record still represents the same actual person before saving their changes.

        :linenos:

How concurrency tokens work in EF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data stores can enforce concurrency tokens by checking that any record being updated or deleted still has the same value for the concurrency token that was assigned when the context originally loaded the data from the database. 

For example, relational database achieve this by including the concurrency token in the ``WHERE`` clause of any ``UPDATE`` or ``DELETE`` commands and checking the number of rows that were affected. If the concurrency token still matches then one row will be updated. If the value in the database has changed, then no rows are updated.

.. code-block:: sql

    UPDATE [Person] SET [Name] = @p1
    WHERE [PersonId] = @p0 AND [SocialSecurityNumber] = @p2;

Ignoring Types and Properties
-----------------------------

EF uses conventions to discover the types and properties that should be included in your model. Including a type or property in your model means that it will be saved to and queried from the database.

Ignore a type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following code shows how to ignore an entire type from your model.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/IgnoreType.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 6-22
        :emphasize-lines: 7
        :linenos:

Ignore a property
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following code shows how to ignore a property from a type.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/IgnoreProperty.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 6-23
        :emphasize-lines: 7-8
        :linenos:

Relational database configuration
---------------------------------

The configuration in this section is applicable to relational databases in general. The extension methods shown here will become available when you install a relational database provider (due to the shared *EntityFramework.Relational* package).

.. note::
    Not all relational database will support all configuration shown here. For example, SQLite does not support the concept of schemas.

Relational table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following code maps the ``Blog`` class to a ``blogs`` table in the database.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Relational/Table.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-21
        :emphasize-lines: 7-9
        :linenos:

You can also specify a scema that the table belongs to.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Relational/TableAndSchema.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 11-13
        :emphasize-lines: 3
        :linenos:

Relational column
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following code maps the ``Blog.BlogId`` property to a ``blog_id`` column in the database.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Relational/Column.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-22
        :emphasize-lines: 7-10
        :linenos:

Relational data type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following code specifies that the column for ``Blog.Url`` should use the ``varchar(200)`` datatype.

.. note::
    If you are targetting more than one relational provider with the same model then you probably 

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Relational/DataType.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-22
        :emphasize-lines: 7-10
        :linenos:

Relational generated properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. caution::
    In Beta 4 there are a number of issues with the APIs for configuring generated properties. The examples here show how to configure for SQL Server.

The following code turns off database value generation for a column that was setup to have values generated in the database by convention.

.. literalinclude:: configuring/sample/EFModelling.Configuring.FluentAPI/Samples/Relational/NoValueGeneration.cs
        :language: c#
        :lines: 5-22
        :emphasize-lines: 7-10
        :linenos:

.. caution::
    **SQL Server and sequence vs. identity**

    By default, when targetting SQL Server, EF will use a global sequence to generate values for numeric primary keys. The values will be retrieved in blocks from the database and assigned to entities when they are added to the context. If you want to swap to using values that are generated using the ``IDENTITY`` pattern during  ``SaveChanges`` then add a call to ``modelBuilder.ForSqlServer().UseIdentity()`` at the top of ``OnModelCreating``. 

    In future pre-releases this behavior will change to use the ``IDENTITY`` pattern by default.
